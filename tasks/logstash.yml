  # Two-pass approach. Even listing the plugins takes several seconds,
  # but it's worth it to pay that overhead rather than the several tens
  # of seconds it takes to "install" the plugin, even if it's already installed.
  # A separate action is necessary to upgrade the plugin, so simply checking
  # the plugin's presence is sufficient for idempotence.
